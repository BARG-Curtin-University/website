Associate Professor Nik Thompson leads the Discipline of Business Information Systems in FBL and is co-founder of the Business AI Research Group (BARG). He is a Senior Certified Professional of the Australian Computer Society and a Senior Fellow of the Higher Education Academy.

In his early work as a Computer Scientist, he developed and researched robotics, IoT, sensor networks and invented new equipment to use medical technologies for psycho-physiological research. Through this, he gained an appreciation that people are the most crucial element for technology to be useful and to succeed. Since then, he has focussed on the Human-Computer Interaction domain exploring the psychological, cognitive, and affective aspects of computer use.

His research approach is quantitative, involving measures of human behaviours and perceptions to empirically determine the best ways to support everyday individuals in a society where technology is ubiquitous.
